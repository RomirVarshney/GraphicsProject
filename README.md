# GraphicsProject

This is the file for my graphics project, which was a project that I had to complete in school, as an introduction to graphical code in Java.

My graphics project is a 2-D city consisting of 5 buildings, each one with a multitude of windows and levels to it, as well as different colors, giving the city a vibrant feel.

My picture contains a sun, clouds, a bird, and a road as well as the buildings

Image pulled from www.easy2dart.com.

It contains over 700 lines of code, utilizing line commands, block commands, color, and circular and elliptical code in creating the sun and the bird.

There are comments made throughout the program to help organize the code and make it easier to read and follow through.

Completed in about a month, in class periods of 90 minutes, which occurred every other school day.
