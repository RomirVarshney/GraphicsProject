# GraphicsProject

This is the file for my graphics project, which was a project that I had to complete in school, as an introduction to graphical code in Java.
My graphics project is a 2-D city consisting of 5 buildings, each one with a multitude of windows and levels to it.
There is a sun, clouds, a bird, and a road as well as the buildings ***
I pulled this from www.easy2dart.com. This website was showing how to draw a simple 2-D city. After seeing the drawing, I decided to use that as my project, and it was accepted.
It contains over 700 lines of code, utilizing line commands, block commands, color, and circular and elliptical code in creating the sun and the bird.
There are comments made throughout the program to help organize the code and make it easier to read and follow through.
